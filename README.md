First attempt to actually publish a little code assistant.

Run Admin

Special Thanks to DSSSA for the request. Hope this helps...

We Extracted his data dump and cleaned it up with 6 Digit IDs, and Descriptors, then parsed the file to write out a new folder for each and every entry in the CSV file.

Gotta give credit, where credit is due... also a special thanks to my friend Grok for sanity checking my base, prior to publishing and catching a couple of "Best practice" suggestions.
